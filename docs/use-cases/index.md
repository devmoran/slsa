# Use cases

<span class="subtitle">

The following are some typical cases to explore how SLSA compliance can provide protection. In each, we’ve detailed goals that users need to meet, how organisations can use the SLSA framework to help meet them, and limitations that might be faced.

For a [full example](../example.md) that explores edge cases in greater detail, we created a use case for using curl through its official docker image.

These are only a few of the most common use cases for developers, software consumers and repository maintainers.  We welcome any real life scenarios you’ve faced using SLSA in your projects. [Want to contribute?](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa/tree/main/case-studies)
