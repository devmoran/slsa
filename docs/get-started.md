hero_text: If you’re looking to jump straight in and try SLSA, here’s a quick start guide for the steps to take to reach the first SLSA level. Level 1 ensures that you’re setting up the foundation of trust in a system and that all your applications are generating appropriate provenance data. It also sets a baseline to achieve higher SLSA compliance later, which we explain in detail below.

### Reaching SLSA Level 1

                        This guide will help you achieve Level 1, and it should take less than a couple of hours for an individual project. By following the steps, you’ll soon be compliant with these SLSA requirements:
<ul class="list-disc mt-6 pl-4"><li class="pb-4">Producing provenance data</li>
<li class="pb-4">Automating your builds</li></ul>

### Building to higher levels

                    <p>Once the foundations are in place with Level 1, you can start looking towards the higher levels to further strengthen artifact integrity with central monitoring, authentication and automated compilation, as well as more secure development practices. But there’s a few things to consider first:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc mt-6 pl-4">
                    <li class="pb-4">Decide what level is appropriate for your project in the short term and for your immediate needs. It can take years to achieve the ideal security state, so having intermediate milestones is important.</li>
<li class="pb-4">You can progressively attain higher SLSA levels. Each artifact’s SLSA level is independent from each another, allowing parallel progress and prioritization based on risk.</li>
<li class="pb-4">Not all projects require Level 4, and for others it’s impossible to achieve. If it seems unrealistic for your project, concentrate on Level 3 instead.</li></ul>
